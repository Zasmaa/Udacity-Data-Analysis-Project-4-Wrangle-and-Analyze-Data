    "This is an outline of the project 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I.\tIntroduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tThe goal of this project is to understand how to gather, assess, and clean data. In this particular project, we gather data from different sources.  The source was twitter API,  Udacity’s servers and tweet archive from twitter user dog rates.  \n",
    "**II.\tGather Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tImport all library required for this project. \n",
    "b.\tRequest the URL from the Udacity’s servers and essential into a data Frame, this particular file is in .tsv format. Make sure to ad “sep = \\t”\n",
    "c.\tThen query the Twitter API by getting your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret.  \n",
    "d.\tAlso, get the twitter-archive-enhance.csv into a data-Frame. Then create a JSON file and dump the twitter archive CSV into the JSON\n",
    "e.\tThe last step is to create a data-Fram from the JSON. \n",
    "III.\tAssess Data \n",
    "a.\tThey assess that data is split into two-part. \n",
    "b.\tThe first one is a visual assessment \n",
    "i.\tThis part will look at the whole data frame to see were to clean as a whole. \n",
    "ii.\t\n",
    "c.\tThe second one is the Programmatic Assessment.\n",
    "i.\tThis will use a code to look into the quality and tidiness of the data. \n",
    "ii.\tSome of the codes use is \n",
    "1.\tInfo()- to see the data type and non-null\n",
    "2.\tDescribe – to see the mean, std, min, and max. \n",
    "3.\tSample ()- to see the last five of the data\n",
    "4.\tDuplicated\n",
    "iii. Make a note for each mistake that needs to be clean. Separate into quality and tidiness. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IV.\tClean Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tCreate a copy of the original data \n",
    "b.\tClean each a mistake by define, then code corrections  and last test to see if everything is correct. \n",
    "i.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "**V.\tAnalyzing and visualizing data**\n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tAnalyze your data and make graphs \n",
